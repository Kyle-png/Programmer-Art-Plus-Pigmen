# Programmer Art + Pigmen
This is a fork of "Programmer Art+ Resource Pack for Minecraft 1.20.x", At this point, I have only replaced the textures for the Piglin, Piglin Brute, and Zombie Piglin to look more like Pigmen. Pigmen were Mojang's original concept for the Piglins. I have also made the Hoglin and Zoglin look more like overworld pigs. 

This pack is fully vanilla, no mods required. This is a Java Edition pack. Feel free to convert this to Bedrock Edition.
